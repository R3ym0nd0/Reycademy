## 🙌 Why I'm Building This

I'm building this because I saw that there are not many Tagalog cybersecurity lessons here in the Philippines. Most topics here are about web development or programming only. So I made Reycademy to help my fellow Filipinos who also want to learn cybersecurity in a simple and free way.
